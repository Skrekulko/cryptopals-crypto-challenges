### Crypto Challenge Set 3
This is the next set of **block cipher cryptography** challenges (even the randomness stuff here plays into block cipher crypto).

This set is **moderately difficult**. It includes a famous attack against CBC mode, and a "cloning" attack on a popular RNG that can be annoying to get right.

We've also reached a point in the crypto challenges where all the challenges, with one possible exception, are valuable in breaking real-world crypto.

17. The CBC padding oracle
18. Implement CTR, the stream cipher mode
19. Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitutions
20. Break fixed-nonce CTR statistically
21. Implement the MT19937 Mersenne Twister RNG
22. Crack an MT19937 seed
23. Clone an MT19937 RNG from its output
24. Create the MT19937 stream cipher and break it
